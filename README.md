Finding a wishlist app that does what I need (and preferably nothing else) has proved fruitless. Right now, BoxedUp has the best social experience (friending, reserving, good URLs), but Amazon has the best authoring experience (extensions for all browsers, a good bookmarklet and a nice editing interface).

Getting the experience right is obviously tricky. BoxedUp proves that making an ad-based wish listing service is even trickier.

What I need:
* An easy way to add to my wish list(s) from practically anywhere
* A way to mark a gift as purchased ("reserved" on BoxedUp)
* Multiple wish lists, with pretty URLs
* Friending, probably symmetric to support reservations
* Simple (potentially themeable) wish list views

## Simplifying Assumptions
* Mobile first
* Hot link images
